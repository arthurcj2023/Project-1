            <p class="paragraph">Maintaining a used car is vitally important to keeping the car running smoothly and not
                breaking down. There are quite a few basic things that can be done to keep a car in good physical and
                mechanical condition. The list below will have a bunch of things that can be done to maintain a vehcile
                and a guide on how to complete those maintainence tasks.</p>


            <h3>Changing the oil</h3>
            <p>Changing your vehicles oil is a very good thing to learn as it saves a lot of money because most mechanic
                shops steeply overcharge for an oil change. You can usually find the instructions on the amount and type
                of oil to use in the vehicles manual or online. When it comes to changing the oil, there is a bolt on
                the bottom of your vehicles oil pan that you should put a bucket under. Unscrew the bolt and let the oil
                drain out for a few minutes. Once the flow stops, screw the bolt back in. Move to the valve cover of the
                engine and remove the oil fill cap. Next pour the type and amount of oil that is for your vehicle into
                the hole on top of the engine. Once you have poured all of the oil in, screw the cap on. that's all you
                have to do to change your oil. Below are images containing the steps to change your oil.</p>

            <h3>Changing transmission fluid</h3>
            <p>Changing your transmission fluid is similar to changing your oil. On an automatic transmission, find the
                drain bolt and unscrew it with a bucket underneath. Allow the transmission pan to fully drain before
                screwing the bolt back in. Then find the fill hole for your transmission and pour the recommended amount
                of transmission fluid into it. Replace the cap or dipstick and you are all finished.</p>

            <h3>Replacing a flat tire</h3>
            <p>Keep in mind that not all vehicles have a spare wheel. check underneath your trunk flooring to see if you
                have a jack, a tire iron, and most importantly the spare tire. Place the car jack so that it is closest
                to your flat tire. Use the tire iron to break the lugnuts on the wheel. Next jack up the car and remove
                all of the lugnuts and the wheel with the flat tire. Place the space tire and tighten all of the lug
                nuts. Lower the car and put the tools back in your trunk, and put the wheel with a flat tire in the
                trunk as well.</p>
