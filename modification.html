            <p class="main-paragraph">Modifications are where you really get to let your car shine. These modifications
                will improve vehicle
                performance and the driver's experience. Almost all of these modifications can be done by anyone, but
                the last one is much more involved but also yields the largest gain in performance. Any of these
                modifications will set a project car apart from a stock car. this carousel allows you to view the
                benefits and our rating on difficulty of installing the components that make up the modification. Each
                section will include a list of links to reputable manufacturers/sellers of parts suited for such
                modifications.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-header">Intake</h3>
                <p class="description-paragraph">Intake modifications are the easiest to install on a project car.
                    They usually involve undoing very few
                    bolts and then removing the old intake and replacing it with a new performance header. Intake
                    headers
                    will not yield more than a 5 horsepower gain, but are an important prerequisite if you plan to
                    modify
                    your vehicle with a forced induction kit.</p>

                <p class="description-paragraph">Suspension modifications change how your project car handles the
                    road. Better suspension will reduce body
                    torsion as well as increase road grip on tighter corners. Suspension is moderately difficult to
                    install
                    because it requires the vehicle to be jacked up. It is also difficult because suspension
                    component bolts
                    are very tight and there are many of them that will need to be removed and reinstalled once the
                    new
                    suspension kit is installed.</p>

                <p class="description-paragraph">Brake modifications are simple and improve how the car feels when
                    braking. The car will feel much more
                    effective in braking which is very useful for more expressive driving, such as drifting. Brake
                    modifications are moderately difficult due to very heavily torqued bolts on the brake calipers,
                    and the
                    inherent risks of performing brake modifications incorrectly.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-header">Exhaust</h3>
                <p class="description-paragraph">Exhaust modifications are what make a project car sound like a race
                    car. Exhaust modifications turn heads
                    if done right. Improper or cheap exhaust modifications make a car sound like it is in a state of
                    disrepair rather than a speed demon. exhaust modifications can also improve performance of your
                    car due
                    to an increase in the flow of exhaust gasses in a wider diameter exhaust pipe. exhaust
                    modifications are
                    relatively difficult due to the fact that you have to be under the vehicle while installing the
                    exhaust
                    system, and the size of the exhaust pipes you will install will determine the difficulty of
                    fitment and
                    may require fabrication of custom parts. Exhaust modifications are a good thing to perform if
                    you are
                    considering implementing a forced induction modification.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-header">Forced induction</h3>
                <p class="description-paragraph">Forced induction is the defacto way to improve performance of your
                    vehicle. Forced induction has the
                    greatest risk of damaging your vehicles engine and transmission, and should only be done if you
                    are very
                    confident in your abilities to perform the modification. Forced induction works by packing more
                    air into
                    the engine block before combustion, allowing the fuel system to pump more fuel and make more
                    power.
                    forced induction in small amounts is relatively safe with an otherwise stock vehicle, but more
                    performant modifications will require upgrades to the fuel system, the intake, the exhaust, and
                    the
                    transmission to ensure that your vehicle can handle the extra power it is making. this
                    modification is
                    extremely difficult and is not for the faint of heart, so if you can do it you should should be
                    very
                    proud of yourself.</p>
