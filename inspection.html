            <p class="main-paragraph">A pre-purchase inspection is the most important aspect of buying a project car from a
                private seller. The inspection is the time to assess the condition of the car, the mechanics of the car,
                and gauge the natrue of the sellers use of the car. To make thign easier, the instructions on how to
                complete a full inspection will be split into three parts. You can click on any of the 3 steps below to
                be taken directly to their guide.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-header" id="exterior">Exterior inspection:</h2>
            <p class="category-description">Inspecting the exterior of the vehicle is the easiest of the three steps, but that
                doesn't mean that you can skip over it. Inspecting the exterior may also give insights to the mechanical
                section of the inspection. Follow the steps below and use the checklist to keep track of all of the
                things for the exterior of the car. Be sure to use the checklist at the bottom of the page to keep track
                of all of these checks, and be sure to remember any problem that I say may be important in the
                mechanical stage.
            </p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>
                    <h3>Wheels, tires, and rims</h3>
                    <p>The wheels, tires, and rims are a good indicator of the cleanliness of the car. Start by checking
                        to see if there is any noticable scraping on the rim, this is known as <i>curb rash</i> and is
                        indicative of the car scrapign against a curb of other object. Next check the tread on the tire,
                        this can be done by taking a penny and putting it in the tread so that Lincoln's face is down.
                        If you can see the majority of Lincoln's head, then the tires will have to be replaced soon. the
                        next thing to check for is brake dust or grease on the rims. Brake-dust is simply black powder
                        and is completely normal to find on a vehicle. Brake-dust should come off of the rim just by
                        brushing it with your finger. The more concering thing that could be on the tire is grease;
                        lagre amounts of grease are a red flag and should be noted as something to remember for the
                        mechanical portion of the inspection.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Windshields, sunroofs, and moonroofs</h3>
                    <p>Windshileds are quite simple to check, look for any deep scratches in the drivers windshield,
                        these could mean that the wiper blades were scraping against the glass meaning a new set of
                        wiper blades is a necessity. Next check for and <i>stars</i> in the windshiled where something
                        may have caused it to begin cracking. Stars can be easily filled, but it is something you should
                        note. Next check the rubber sealant gaskets on all of the windows. If these are decaying or
                        missing, it means that water has been able to leak into the door frame potentially causing
                        internal rusting and speaker system damage. Lastly, check the moonroof and/or sunroof and ensure
                        that there are no obvious signs of things being misaligned or anything that could potentially
                        cause a leak. Check the side mirrors and make sure that they are present, and that the glass is
                        in good condition</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Paint, chrome, body shape</h3>
                    <p>The paint, chrome and body shape are what most people will be looking at when they see a car on
                        the road. The main things to check for are places where paint is peeling, places where rust has
                        formed, and places where the body of the vehicle is dented. If the car has been in an accident,
                        and you see large body deformation, keep that in mind for the mechanical inspection as there may
                        be frame damage to the vehicle which is a very important thing to check. For the chrome of the
                        vehicle, see if it is tarnished or damaged, as it is difficult to restore by yourself.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Head-lights and tail-lights</h3>
                    <p>the last thing that you need to check for the exterior inspection are the head-lights and
                        tail-lights. You want to be able to clearly see a bulb from the outside and check the color of
                        the plastic covers to make sure that it hasn't faded or yellowed over the years. If there is,
                        not to worry, it takes about 30 minutes per light to fully restore the headlight, the last thing
                        to check for is water in the headlights. this is cause for concern because it indicates that the
                        light has a leak that water is entering which could cause short circuits that could damage more
                        than just your headlights.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="sub-header" id="interior">Interior inspection:</h2>
            <p class="category-description">The interior is where you the driver and your passengers will be spending the most
                time. This means that
                the interior should be in good condition, so it is presentable. Just like the exterior there are many
                different things to worry about in the interior. Follow the steps below to make sure you check all of
                the major things that deal with the interior of the vehicle. Be sure to use the checklist at the bottom
                of the page to keep track of your inspection, and keep in mind anything to do with the interior of the
                vehicle that also relates to any mechanical aspect of the car.</p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>
                    <h3>Dashboard panel, sidepanels, and center console.</h3>
                    <p>Inspect the dashboard panel for any cracks or missing chunks, this is a
                        common damage to project cars, as the dash panel sits in the sun all day and is prone to
                        crackign
                        as a result, finding a
                        dash in good condition is quite difficult and comes with a high price tag, so if a good dash is
                        an important factor to you, then you may want to steer away from vehciles with a less than
                        desirable dash panel. When checking the side panels, see if all of the button controls work and
                        that there are no odd sounds when you roll, up and down the window. Weird sounds when rollijng
                        the window up or down mean that the motor for that window is in poor condition and will have to
                        be replaced eventually. Replacign a window motor is not difficult, however buyign a new motor is
                        quite expensive as this is a common point of faliure for a project car. When checking the center
                        console make sure that all of the buttons work and that all of the knobs work as well. Do not
                        worry about AC and turn signals, as those will be covered in the mechanical section.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Seats, carpet, and roof lining</h3>
                    <p>First check to make sure that the drivers seat and passenger seat are bolted into the floor
                        panel. The last thing you want to do is get into an accident and fly out of your vehicle because
                        the seat was not bolted securely. Next check and make sure all of the seat adjustment knobs are
                        working. Next inspect the physical condition of the seat; is it frayed or torn, does it have a
                        bad smell? A torn or smelly seat can be fixed with bleach and seat covers, but if you value the
                        original seat condition, this may be a big factor in making a purchase. Next check the carpet,
                        look for holes in the carpet and more importantly any holes in tyhe floor pan. Holes in the
                        floor pan usually mean rust and mold are in the carpet of the vehicle. Fixing a hole in a floor
                        pan usually involves welding a patch, so it requires tools and knowledge that can cost quite a
                        bit of time and money. Lastly, check the roof lining, this is mostly an asthetic thing, but if
                        there any holes in the roof then the same type of work must be done as described in the floor
                        panels case.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Audio system, backup camera, and radio HUD</h3>
                    <p>Start by turning on the radio and playing some music, then in the radio change the balance so
                        that only one speaker is playing, by doing this for all 4 speakers you cna make sure that they
                        are all operational. Next check that the bass is good and that there is no weird noises coming
                        from the speakers. Next check the vehicles backup camera if it has one. Put the car in reverse
                        and have someone go stand where the camera can see them. This will let you see if the camera is
                        updating and if it detects objects in its path. Lastly, check the hud near the climate control
                        and make sure this works, on older cars this doesn't exist, so you can skip this part of the
                        step.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="sub-header" id="mechanical">Mechanical inspection</h2>
            <p class="category-description">the mechanical inspection is the most important step of the inspection as it makes sure
                that the car can
                perform all of the tasks it needs to in order to be a good purchase. Cars with mechanical problems or
                that are not mechanically sound can be a real trouble down the road when the car breaks down and the
                owner has to tow it somewhere and then pay a mechanic to fix it. These checks are made to ensure that a
                car only needs minor routine maintainence over time instead of spending tons of moey buying replacement
                parts and paying mechanics to install them.</p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>
                    <h3>Tires, brakes, and suspension</h3>
                    <p>Check the tires again for any holes or major damage, next go put youe hands on the body of the
                        car above each wheel. One at a time press down with all of your strength onto the the top of the
                        vehicle and release. Watch the amount that it bounces after. Ideally there should only be one
                        visiblly full bounce before the suspension stops rocking the vehicle. Also be listening for
                        squeaking sounds that that may indicate the need for new shock suspension, or sway bar. Next
                        check the brakes. Start by engaging the emergency breake while the vehicle is on and in drive.
                        then press the gas lightly until the car begins to roll slowly. Doing this wuill see how
                        adjusted the emergency brake is and how much life is left in the drums that serve the purpose of
                        the emergency brake. Do the same thing with the regular brakes that you did with the emergency
                        brake. While using the normal brake, ensure that the brakes increase in pressure as you increase
                        the force you push down the pedal with, if the brakes are without resistance for the entire path
                        of travel, then there is either a lot of air in the brake systaem, or there is a leak somewhere
                        in the brake system, both of these problems are very bad and can take lots of time and money to
                        fix.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Fuel, intake, and exhaust system</h3>
                    <p> Start by turning the key to the on poisition, there should be a very quiet humming. That humming
                        is the fuel pump increasing pressure in the lines anticipating the car being started. If the
                        whir is accompanied by sounds of grinding then there may be a problem with the vehicles fuel
                        system. Pop the hood of the car and inepct the intake pipes, look for leaks of colored liquid
                        and large collections of carbon dust, these could indicate bad timing or bad valves on the
                        engine. Fixing either one of those issues is quite difficult and time consuming. Next turn the
                        car on and check for overly loud exhaust sounds, these could indicate a hole in the exhaust
                        system, which are easily fixed, but are quite a dirty job.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Electrical systems</h3>
                    <p>Check that when you put the keys in the vehicle and turn the key to the on position, that all of
                        the dash lights turn on for a short period of time. Put the keys in the vehicle and start the
                        car. If the car doesn't make a whirring sound or doesn't start, then there could be a problem
                        with the battery or the starter motor. Check the voltage on the vehciles battery, if it under 12
                        volts then the battery either needs a charge or is no longer working. Check that the fans blow
                        on the ac and that all of the headlights turn on. If the lights in the gauge cluster dim when a
                        front light is on, it is possible that the battery or alternator need to be replaced. Most of
                        the parts that could be broken are easy to replace if needed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Combustion, timing, and throttle-body</h3>
                    <p>Start these checks with the car on. Put the car in park or neutral. Floor the gas pedal and
                        listen to the engine, it should just sound like a roar. Any other sounds are a big worry as it
                        is extremely difficult and expensive to fix engine parts. Take your foot off of the gas slowly
                        and listen to the engine as it decelerates. Listen to the engine on idle for the same odd
                        noises. If there are no odd noises then the engine component of the vehiccle is alright and
                        doesn't need any further checks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Transmission, clutch, and other drivetrain components.</h3>
                    <p>The amount of work required to fix issues in this category are dependent upon whether the
                        vehicles transmission is manual or automatic. In an automatic transmission, you just need to
                        make sure that the vehicle shifts to all gears and makes no odd sounds while the transmission is
                        engaged. On a manual transmission, it is important that you also make sure that the clutch isn't
                        slipping or making any noises. If the shfting and potentially clutch sound smooth then the
                        transmission is likely in good shape as well. The last thing to check are the axles and the rear
                        differential if the car is rear wheel drive or all wheel drive. Listen for popping while
                        steering or other odd noises associated with the wheels rotating.</p>
